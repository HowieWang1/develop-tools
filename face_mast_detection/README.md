## this two file can be used to train the DL model used to detecting face mask
1. pytorch_COVID_19.py used to tran a DL NN model.
2. MultiFace_Mask_Detect.py is used to grab the frame from the video stream, and then pass the frame into the model, finally get the detection result.
3. the output like follows:
# with mask

# without mask

## BYW
if you want get the database, or the model which has been trained successfully, pls refer to
